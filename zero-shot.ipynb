This gives us $\\frac{10}{1.5} = \\frac{20}{3}$ = 6.67 (approximately). Billy will spend 7 dollars of the original $10 on candy. He will have 3 dollars left over for gumballs. Now, each gumball costs $.05 so to find out how many he can buy with $3 we need to divide 3 by .05. This gives us $\\frac{30}{5} = 6$ times, so Billy can buy 60 gumballs. However, he only buys 40 gumballs. So the amount of money left is 3 - $.05 * 20 = $3 - $1 = $2. Since he spent half his change on gumballs, then Billy has $4 for candy originally and spends 7 dollars. This means that there must have been $4 - $7 = -$3 in change.

      "Lorraine has 30 small stickers, so trading away 90% or 0.9 x 30 = 27 is equivalent to keeping 3. Each large sticker can be traded for a large button or three small buttons, so Lorraine started with 40 * (1 + 3) = 160 buttons. Trading away 50% of the large stickers is trading away half of those, which is 80 buttons. That leaves her with 160 - 80 = 80 buttons from large stickers. She also trades some small stickers for buttons. Since she kept 30/3 = 10 small stickers worth of buttons, and each was worth one button, she had another 10 buttons. So she has 80 + 10 = 90 buttons total at the start. At the end, after trading away 27 small stickers worth of buttons, which is 27 buttons, Lorraine has 90 - 27 = 63 buttons. The answer is 63.\n",

      "Let x be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn and y the number of times she mowed Joe's. Then we know 3y = x. So then x = 3y. Now let w be the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn, which is equal to 5y. So then w = 5y. Now let z be the total amount Tasha earned from her work, or the sum of what Joe and Kamala paid her for their lawns. Then we know that z = y * 6 + (3y) * ? (for how much she got from Kamala). Since the total for Kamala's lawn is 3x, which is equal to 3y, then it must be 3y * ?. So z = 6y + 3y * ?, and since we know what y is (it's equal to 80 / 12), then let y = 20. Then we can substitute y for 20 in the equation above. So z = 6(20) + 3(20) * ?. And that is equal to 120 + 180, or 300. Now what did she get from her lemonade sales? That's 80 - 300, which is -220! But we know that can't be right because Tasha didn't lose money selling lemonade. So then there must have been an error somewhere in the problem. Let us re-examine it. The first week, Joe paid 6 for his lawn and Kamala's was three times as much. Then Alba's was five times as much as Joe's. We know that the total amount she earned from her work is 80 dollars, which is 300 - 220 = 80. So then we just need to figure out how many times Tasha mowed each lawn. Let x be the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn and y the number of times she mowed Joe's. Then we know that 3y = x and w = 5y, where w is Alba's lawn. We also know that z = 6y + (3y) * ?, which we previously solved as 300. Now let us substitute for y in the equation above 6y + (3y) * ? = 300. Then we have 6(20) + 3(20) * ?. That is equal to 120 + 180, or 300. We know that this is true because it was solved as 80 earlier! So then let y = 20. Now since Alba's lawn is five times as much as Joe's, then w = 5y. So w = 100. Since Kamala's lawn is three times as much as Joe's, then x = 3y. So x = 60. And finally, we know that y is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Then y = 20. So what did she get from her lemonade sales? That's 80 - 300, which is -220! But we know that can't be right because Tasha didn't lose money selling lemonade.

      "Let p be the age of Peter, j the age of John and let p = j + 10 (since Paul is 10 years older). Also p + j + Jean = 100. Then j + 10 + j + Jean = 100 so that j + j + Jean - 10 = 90. That means that Jean + j = 80. Then p = j + 10 and p = j, which is j + 10 = j, or 10 = 0, which is false. Then we should substitute the expression for p into the equation above to get (j + 10) + j + Jean = 100. So j + j + 10 + Jean = 100, so that 2j + 10 + Jean = 100. That means that 2j + Jean = 90, which is the same as j + Jean = 45. Then p + j = 55 since p = j + 10 and p + j = 55. So p = 55 - j. We can then substitute this into (j + 10) + j + Jean = 100 to get (55 - j) + j + Jean = 100, which is the same as 55 + Jean = 100. Then Jean = 45 since Jean = 45 and we know that Jean = 45. So p + j + Jean = 100 becomes 55 + j + 45 = 100, or 100 = 100, which means that everything checks out. Finally, since p = 55 - j, then p is the age of Peter which is 25 since p = 55 - j and we know that j = 30. The answer is 25.\n",

      "The first step in this problem is to realize that we can subtract 4 from 33, because Donny poured some of the cold water away. So it becomes 29 degrees. We know that after pouring one ounce of the other mug into the drinkable mixture (29 + ?) and then mixing well, he could now drink the water. This means that he could now mix with the 40 degree line. Since we don't know how many ounces were in the first or second mug, we can assume they are each full to start off with because it's not specified otherwise. The only unknown is what temperature the other bottle was at. We need to figure out how many degrees this must have been to get a 40 degree mixed drink. When you put something into another thing and mix them together, that is called mixing. It doesn't matter if they are different things or not. So when we put the two liquids together, it becomes 29 + ? = 40. The temperature of the other bottle must be at least (40 - 29) = 11 degrees.\n",

      "The predicted answer is: Let x equal the number of tennis balls collected in the second set. Then the number of tennis balls collected in the third set was half of that or x/2. The number of tennis balls collected in the first set is then x + 4. So we have a equation like this: x + (x+4) + (x/2) = 19. We can simplify this by pulling out an x on each side, to get x + x + x + 4 + (1/2)x = 19. Then we combine like terms and get 3.5x + 4 = 19. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3.5x = 15. Dividing by 3.5, we get that x is equal to 4.25. But since we can't have a fraction of balls, this means the number of tennis balls in the second set was 4 and not 4.25. So then the first set has 8 (since 4 + 4 = 8) and the third set has 2. This all adds up to 19. The answer is 8.\n",

Now the houses total up to 250. The first house is x/2 and the second is x. So together they are x/2 + x = 1.5x. Then the third house's contribution needs to be 250 - 1.5x, because we already counted what the first two houses need. We know that x is how many boxes the second house gets, so this means the third house will get 250 - 1.5x. But we also know that each box has 120 shingles, and each case (box) has 10. So we multiply by 10 to turn it into cases. We get 2,500 - 15x. Now we can set up the equation for this problem. x + x/2 + (2500-15x)/10 = 250. Multiply both sides by 10 and simplify.
