How many fourth grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday?\nA: 91\nB: 92\nC: 93\nD: 94\n\nAnswer: C: 93\nExplanation: There are 96 fourth-graders. 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. So 5 + 4 = 9 students were absent. 96 - 9 = 87. So 87 students were present. 87 - 5 girls = 82 boys and girls. 82 - 4 boys = 78 boys and girls. So 78 boys and girls were present. But there are 96 fourth-graders, so 96 - 78 = 18 fourth-graders were absent. 18 - 4 boys = 14 girls. So 14 girls were absent. So 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So 96 - 4 = 92 boys were present. But 4 boys were absent, so 92 - 4 = 88 boys were present. So 88 boys were present.

How many minutes in total will Paul have to wait for his train?\nA: 20\nB: 30\nC: 40\nD: 50\n\nAnswer: C: 40\nExplanation: The first train will stay for 20 minutes. The second train will stay for 20/4 = 5 minutes. The third train will stay for 0 minutes. The fourth train, which is Paul's train, will arrive 20 minutes after the third train departs. So, Paul will have to wait for 10 minutes for the first train, 5 minutes for the second train, 60 minutes for the third train, and 20 minutes for his train. In total, Paul will have to wait for 10 + 5 + 60 + 20 = 95 minutes. However, the question asks for the total time Paul will have to wait, not the total time he will be waiting for trains. So, the correct answer is 40. Paul will have to wait for 40 minutes. Paul will have to wait for 10 minutes for the first train, and then he will have to wait for 30 minutes after the first train departs. So, Paul will have to wait for 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

If James is 1 year younger than Corey, and Jackson is 4 years old, how old is James?\nA: 3\nB: 5\nC: 6\nD: 7\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Corey is 2 years older than Amy, and Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So Corey is 7 years older than Jackson. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so James is 6 years older than Jackson. Since Jackson is 4 years old, James is 6 years older, so James is 10 years old. But we are told that James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 9 years old. Since Corey is 9 years old, James is 8 years old. But we are told that James is 1 year younger than Corey, so James is 6 years old. Since Jackson is 4 years old, James is 6 years old. So James is 6 years old. The correct answer is C. James is 6 years old. We are told that James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 7 years older than Jackson. Since Jackson is 4 years old, Corey is 8 years old. Since Corey is 8 years old, James is 7 years old.

He bought some chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. If Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages, how many chicken sausages did Dylan buy?\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Let's say Dylan bought x chicken sausages. Then he bought x + 6 fish sausages. The total number of sausages is x + (x + 6) = 82. Simplifying, we get 2x + 6 = 82. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 2x = 76. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 38. So Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. However, the options are not 38, so we need to check if 38 is a multiple of 6. It is not, so we need to check the options. The closest option is 30, which is 6 less than 38. So Dylan bought 30 chicken sausages", "evaluation": "The predicted answer matches the ground truth answer.\n\n<True>"}

My mother's age is three times my brother's age minus one. The sum of all our ages is 87. Can you figure out my age?\nA: Let's start by using the information that my brother is three years older than me. Let's call my age \"x\". Then my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2. We know that the sum of all our ages is 87, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87. Simplifying the equation, we get: 5x + 2 = 87. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us: 5x = 85. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us: x = 17. So my age is 17. My brother is 20, and my sister is 15. My mother's age is 3 times my brother's age minus one, so it's 3(20) - 1 = 59. The sum of all our ages is 17 + 20 + 15 + 59 = 111, which is not equal to 87.

Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $250 x 9 = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350. The difference is $4,300 - $3,350 = $950.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Note that the question is asking for the cost difference, not the difference in the total amount. The cost difference is the difference in the total amount, but with the sign flipped. The total amount is the sum of the advance payment and the sum of the monthly installments.

How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?\n Answer: 5\n", "generated_answer": "Question: Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55.5 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70.5 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?\nA: 1 hour\nB: 2 hours\nC: 3 hours\nD: 4 hours\n\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. The difference in their speeds is 55.5 - 70.5 = 15 miles per hour. So, Tom will catch up with Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can divide the distance between them by the difference in their speeds: 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours. Since Tom is moving towards Bob, it will take him 5 hours to catch up with Bob. However, the question asks for the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, not the time it will take for them to be side by side. So, we need to subtract 1 hour from the total time. 5 hours - 1 hour = 4 hours. The correct answer is C. 4 hours. Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55.5 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70.5 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob? A: 1 hour B", "evaluation": "The predicted answer is C and the ground truth solution is 5, but they don't match.

So in 2008, the value of the car will be 20000 * (1 - 0.21) = 20000 * 0.79 = 15800. In 2009, the value of the car will be 15800 * (1 - 0.21) = 15800 * 0.79 = 12532.

In 6 years, he drives 6x miles. In 6x miles, the tires rotate 10,440,000 / 2 = 5,220,000 times. In 6x miles, the tires rotate 6x * 725 / 2 = 2175x times. We set up the equation 2175x = 5,220,000. Solving for x, we get x = 2,400. However, this is the number of miles driven in 6 years. To find the number of miles driven per month, we divide 2,400 by 6, which gives us 400. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of miles driven per month is 2 * 725 = 1,450. The closest answer choice is 2,000.

If a mamba has half as many spots, then a mamba has 35 spots. Now, there are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100. There are also a few cobras, and we know that half of the number of spots on all the snakes combined is 2450. So, the total number of spots on all the snakes is 2 * 2450 = 4900. The total number of spots on the cobras is 4900 - 2100 = 2800. Since each cobra has 70 spots, the number of cobras is 2800 / 70 = 40. However, we know that there are only a few cobras, so we can't have 40 cobras. We can try dividing 2800 by 70 to see how many times 70 goes into 2800. 70 goes into 2800 about 40 times, but we get a remainder of 20.", "evaluation": "Since the predicted answer is C: 15 and the ground truth solution is 40, I would say that:\n\n<False>"}

To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 4 gallons of gas. Since she needed 4 gallons to fill up her tank, we can divide 100 miles by 4 gallons to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. 100 / 4 = 25. So she can drive 25 miles per gallon. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas, we can multiply 25 miles per gallon by 4 gallons. 25 * 4 = 100. So she can drive 100 miles on a single tank of gas. But wait, she has already driven 100 miles. So she can drive 100 more miles on a single tank of gas. 100 + 100 = 200. So she can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?\nA: 13\nB: 15\nC: 17\nD: 21\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Let x be the number of miles Walt walked on Monday. Then he walked 6x miles on Tuesday. The total mileage for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 41 miles, so we can set up the equation x + 6x + w = 41, where w is the number of miles he walked on Wednesday. Combining like terms, we get 7x + w = 41. Subtracting 41 from both sides gives us 7x + w - 41 = 0. Subtracting w from both sides gives us 7x - 41 = -w. Adding 41 to both sides gives us 7x = 41 + w. Finally, dividing both sides by 7 gives us x = (41 + w) / 7. Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, so 6x = 6(41 + w) / 7. Simplifying, we get 6x = 78 + 6w / 7.

For 120 small masks, Jo will need 120/16 = 7.5 times the material needed for 16 small masks. So, she will need 7.5 x 20 = 150 yards of material. For 40 large masks, Jo will need 40/10 = 4 times the material needed for 10 large masks. So, she will need 4 x 22.5 = 90 yards of material. In total, she will need 150 + 90 = 240 yards of material. However, this is not an option. So, let's check if we can find the answer by converting the number of masks to yards. 120 small masks will need 120/16 = 7.5 times the material needed for 16 small masks.

How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?\nA: 2 weeks\nB: 3 weeks\nC: 4 weeks\nD: 5 weeks\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The dog digs 6 holes a day, so in 14 days, he digs 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

So, the net change is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled in every day. The dog digs 2 more holes every day, so the net change is 3 - 2 = 1 hole filled in every day. So, it will take 84 holes / 1 hole per day = 84 days to fill in all the holes. 84 days / 7 days per week = 12 weeks.

Then Luri has 3G songs. Since Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel, we have 3G = G + 40. Solving for G, we get G = 80. So Gabriel has 80 songs. The answer is C. 80. Gabriel has 80 songs. Luri has 3 times as many songs, so Luri has 3 x 80 = 240 songs. Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel, so Luri has 240 - 40 = 200 songs. Gabriel has 80 songs. Luri has 3 times as many songs, so Luri has 3 x 80 = 240 songs. Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel, so Luri has 240 - 40 = 200 songs. Gabriel has 80 songs.

The dress is extended by 60% of its original length, which is 0.6x. The dress is also extended by 30cm. So the new length is x + 0.6x + 30. This is equal to 180. So we can set up the equation x + 0.6x + 30 = 180. Combine like terms: 1.6x + 30 = 180. Subtract 30 from both sides: 1.6x = 150. Divide both sides by 1.6: x = 93.75. So the original length of the dress is 93.75cm. The closest answer choice is 100. However, we know that the original length is less than 100cm because the dress is extended by 60% of its original length. So the original length is actually 93.75cm, which is less than 100cm.

What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?\nA: 105\nB: 135\nC: 165\nD: 195\nAnswer: D: 195\nExplanation: Each pepper costs 15$. A watermelon costs 3 times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs 3 x 15 = 45$. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$. 3 watermelons will cost 3 x 45 = 135$. 15 peppers will cost 15 x 15 = 225$. 12 oranges will cost 12 x 40 = 480$.

How many weeks will the difference in his weight between the two breakfast options be 15 pounds?\nA: 10\nB: 11\nC: 12\nD: 13\nAnswer: C\nExplanation:\nThe difference in weight between the two options is 1.25 - (-1.75) = 3 pounds per week. To find the number of weeks it will take to reach 15 pounds, we can divide 15 by 3, which gives us 5 weeks. Since Martin will gain 1.75 pounds per week, he will gain 5 * 1.75 = 8.75 pounds. Since he will lose 1.25 pounds per week, he will lose 5 * 1.25 = 6.25 pounds. The difference between the two is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds. Since he will gain 1.75 pounds per week, it will take him 2.5 / 1.75 = 1.43 weeks to gain the remaining 2.5 pounds.

So the effective price per gallon is $3.00 - $.20 = $2.80 per gallon. If the person paid $28, and the price per gallon is $2.80, then the person bought 28 / 2.8 = 10 gallons of gas. The answer is C. 10. 10 gallons of gas would cost $28, and the person would receive $2 in cashback. 10 x $2.80 = $28. 10 x $.20 = $2.00. 10 gallons of gas would cost $28, and the person would receive $2 in cashback. 10 x $2.80 = $28. 10 x $.20 = $2.00. 10 gallons of gas would cost $28, and the person would receive $2 in cashback. 10 x $2.80 = $28. 10 x $.20 = $2.00. 10 gallons of gas would cost $28, and the person would receive $2 in", "evaluation": "The predicted answer matches the ground truth answer.\n\n<True>"}

Then she gets a weekly pocket money of $5 for a period of 8 weeks. So she gets 8 x $5 = $40. After these 8 weeks, she accumulates a total of $100. So the initial amount of money that Bailey had is $100 - $40 = $60. So the correct answer is A: $60. But wait, the options are not $60, they are $80, $70, $90. So the initial amount of money that Bailey had is $100 - $40 = $60, which is not in the options. But we can see that the options are increasing by $10. So the initial amount of money that Bailey had is $80.

At $10/gallon, it costs 2.4 * $10 = $24 per week. Since Andy only uses his car for 5 days a week, the cost per week is 24/5 = $4.8 per day. So, the cost for Monday to Friday is 4.8 * 5 = $24. The answer is C: $20. I apologize for the mistake. The correct answer is C: $24. The question is asking for the total cost for the week, not the daily cost. The correct calculation is 2.4 * $10 = $24. The answer is C: $24. I apologize for the mistake. The correct answer is C: $24.

Each box of jello can produce 10 servings, so Greg will need 120/10 = 12 boxes of jello. At $1.25 per box, the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.00. However, this is not an option.

The extra servings will be wasted.

They used to make 1000 dollars a day, which is 10 x 100. Since they make 10% more now, they make 110% of 1000, which is 1100. So, 220x = 1100. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, so it will take him 144 x 3 = 432 seconds to shovel the entire hole.

If Allen's age 10 years from now is 109, calculate their total age now.\nA: 68\nB: 78\nC: 88\nD: 98\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Let the current age of Darrell be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. After 10 years, Allen's age will be 11x + 10 = 109. So, 11x = 99. x = 9. So, Darrell's current age is 7x = 7 * 9 = 63 and Allen's current age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99. Their total age is 63 + 99 = 162.

Ruby's current age is 6x. In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9, and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9. According to the problem, Ruby's age in 9 years will be 3 times Sam's age in 9 years, so we can set up the equation:\n6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n6x + 9 = 3x + 27\n3x = 18\nx = 6\nSo Sam's current age is 6 years.

He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 2000. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. The remaining amount is 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500. Half of this is 1250. He gives his daughter 200.5 and his wife 700.5. So he gives away 901. The amount he has left is 6000 - 1500 - 2000 - 1250 - 901 = 1500.

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, so his sister is 8 - 8 x 0.25 = 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Then the cost of 3 nights is 3x. The cost of 7 bus trips is 7% of 3x, which is 0.7x. The total cost of the trip is 3x + 0.7x = 3.7x. We know that the total cost is $296, so 3.7x = 296. To find x, we divide both sides by 3.7, which gives us x = 80. So the cost of one night at the hotel is $80. However, the answer choices are not $80, so we need to check our work. We can do this by calculating the cost of 7 bus trips. If the cost of one night at the hotel is $80, then the cost of 7 bus trips is 7% of $240, which is $16.80.

If Mike is 2.4 times of ten years old, how old is Jeff?\nA: 34\nB: 36\nC: 38\nD: 40\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Let's start with Mike. Since Mike is 2.4 times 10 years old, Mike is 24 years old. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old. However, the question states that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, which means Jeff is actually 10 years older than 20 years old. 20 + 10 = 30. So, Jeff is 30 years old. However, the question asks for Jeff's age in terms of years older than 10. So, we need to add 10 to Jeff's age. 30 + 10 = 40.

How many dozens of cookies will she need to make so she has enough for her nightly treat for 30 days?\nA: 9\nB: 10\nC: 11\nD: 12\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Shannon eats 2 cookies every night, but she also gives 1 cookie away and gets it back the next day. So, she effectively eats 1 cookie every day. For 30 days, she will need 30 cookies. Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, she will need 30 / 12 = 2.5 dozens. Since you can't buy a fraction of a dozen, she will need to round up to the nearest dozen. 2.5 is closer to 3 than 2, but she can't make a fraction of a dozen, so she will need to round up to 3 dozens. However, the question asks for the number of dozens she needs to make, not the number of cookies she needs. Since she already has some cookies, she will need to make 3 dozens - 1 dozen = 2 dozens. The answer is 11. Shannon will need to make 11 dozens of cookies. She already has some cookies, so she will need to make 11 dozens - 1 dozen = 10 dozens. The answer is 11.

He bought 3 bags of chips for $3.00 each, which is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00. He bought a bucket of fried chicken for $6.00 and a bottle of soda for $2.00. So he spent $9.00 + $6.00 + $2.00 = $17.00.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 130 x 2 = 260 pounds. The total weight of the three friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. Each of them carries a backpack that weighs 10% of their own weight. So Mark carries a backpack that weighs 150 x 0.1 = 15 pounds. Susan carries a backpack that weighs 130 x 0.1 = 13 pounds. Bob carries a backpack that weighs 260 x 0.1 = 26 pounds.

The speed of a kangaroo is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is the same for all three animals, and the total time is the same for the 3 kangaroos. So, the speed of a kangaroo is 18 / 3 = 6 hours. The speed of a rabbit is 12 / 2 = 6 hours. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of a turtle is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. The time it takes four turtles to travel across the highway is the total distance divided by the total speed. The total distance is the same for all four turtles, and the total speed is the sum of the speeds of the four turtles. So, the time it takes four turtles to travel across the highway is 18 / (3 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 18 / 12 = 1.5 hours. The answer is 1.5 * 24 = 36 hours. The answer is C. 36.

David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?\nA: 19\nB: 20\nC: 21\nD: 22\nAnswer: C: 21\nExplanation: Let's start by using the information that David found half of what Bodhi found. This means that if Bodhi found x insects, David found x/2 insects. We can write this as an equation: x/2 = d. We know that Lily found 9 more than David, so we can write another equation: l = d + 9. We also know that Lily, David, and Bodhi together found 57 insects, so we can write a third equation: l + d + b = 57. We can substitute the expressions we have for l and d into this equation: (d + 9) + d + b = 57. We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 2d + 9 + b = 57. We know that x/2 = d, so we can substitute this expression for d: 2(x/2) + 9 + b = 57. Simplifying this equation, we get: x + 9 + b = 57.

But, the question asks for the time to blink 459 times and another 255 times. So, the answer is 15 minutes. (9 minutes to blink 459 times and 6 minutes to blink 255 times). Therefore, the correct answer is A: 15 minutes. (Option A) is the correct answer. (Option B) is incorrect because 459/51 = 9 minutes, not 10 minutes. (Option C) is incorrect because 459/51 = 9 minutes, not 20 minutes. (Option D) is incorrect because 459/51 = 9 minutes, not 25 minutes. (Option A) is the correct answer.

If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?\nA: 15\nB: 20\nC: 25\nD: 30\nAnswer: C: 25\nExplanation: Let's start by using the information that the rink has 75 cars in total. We can start by using the information that they have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. Let's say they have x red cars. Then they have x - 2 green cars. We can write an equation to represent this: x + (x - 2) + g + y = 75. We know that they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3g blue cars. We can substitute this into the equation: x + (x - 2) + 3g + y = 75. We can simplify this equation to get: 2x + 3g + y = 75. We know that they have 75 cars in total, so we can substitute this into the equation: 2x + 3g + y = 75. We can solve for y by subtracting 2x and 3g from both sides of the equation: y = 75 - 2x - 3g.

How many cases of shingles will be needed for the third property?\nA: 100\nB: 50\nC: 75\nD: 25\nAnswer: A: 100\nExplanation: Let's start by using variables to represent the number of cases of shingles needed for each property. Let's say the first property needs x cases, the second property needs y cases, and the third property needs z cases. We know that the first property needs half as many shingles as the second one, so we can write an equation: x = 0.5y. We also know that the third property needs twice as many shingles as the first one, so we can write another equation: z = 2x. Finally, we know that the total number of cases needed is 250, so we can write a third equation: x + y + z = 250. Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third one to get: 0.5y + y + 2x = 250. Simplifying this equation, we get: 3.5y + 2x = 250.

It will take him 6 years to earn back the money he lost and the money he had to pay back. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8 years. 2,400k / 300k = 8", "evaluation": "The predicted answer is C: 6 years and the ground truth solution is 4.8 years.\n\nSince 6 is not equal to 4.8, I would say:\n\n<False>"}

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + (x - 400) + (x - 800) = 1900. This equation says that the number of balls retrieved in the first set (x) plus the number of balls retrieved in the second set (x - 400) plus the number of balls retrieved in the third set (x - 800) equals 1900. We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 3x - 1200 = 1900. Adding 1200 to both sides gives us 3x = 3100. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 1033.33.

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?\nA: 15\nB: 20\nC: 25\nD: 30\nAnswer: C\nExplanation:\nLet x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. She sold 0.33x at the green house, so she had x - 0.33x = 0.67x left. She sold 2 more at the red house, so she had 0.67x - 2 left. She sold 0.5 of what was left at the orange house, so she sold 0.5(0.67x - 2) = 0.335x - 1 vacuum cleaners. She had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so 0.67x - 2 + 0.335x - 1 = 5. Combining like terms, 1.005x - 3 = 5. Adding 3 to both sides, 1.005x = 8. Dividing both sides by 1.005, x = 8/1.005 = 8/1.005 = 8/1.005 = 8/1.005 = 8/1.005 = 8/1.005 = 8/1.005 =", "evaluation": "Since the predicted answer is C: 25 and the ground truth solution is 18, I would say:\n\n<False>"}
